# Phase 1: Self-Hosted Foundation Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Nebula can be deployed and operated through a credible self-hosted path with explicit runtime health and durable persistence direction.
**Verified:** 2026-03-15T23:42:49Z
**Status:** human_needed

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Operators can bring up one documented Docker Compose stack for Nebula without editing repository files. | ✓ VERIFIED | `docker compose -f docker-compose.selfhosted.yml config` succeeds; `docs/self-hosting.md` documents one supported path. |
| 2 | The self-hosted path clearly documents Nebula, PostgreSQL, and Qdrant as the supported runtime topology. | ✓ VERIFIED | `docs/self-hosting.md` describes the Nebula/PostgreSQL/Qdrant topology and `docker-compose.selfhosted.yml` defines those services. |
| 3 | Nebula refuses to start outside local mode when dev secrets or the mock premium provider are still configured. | ✓ VERIFIED | `tests/test_settings.py` covers runtime profile, default-secret, and mock-provider rejection; `src/nebula/core/config.py` enforces the checks. |
| 4 | Operators can distinguish liveness from readiness through separate health endpoints. | ✓ VERIFIED | `src/nebula/main.py` exposes `/health`, `/health/ready`, and `/health/dependencies`; `tests/test_health.py` covers the split. |
| 5 | Readiness reports governance-store readiness separately from degraded cache and local-optimization states. | ✓ VERIFIED | `RuntimeHealthService` reports `gateway`, `governance_store`, `semantic_cache`, and `local_ollama`; readiness tests cover degraded optional dependencies. |
| 6 | Governance schema changes are applied through Alembic migrations instead of runtime CREATE TABLE bootstrap. | ✓ VERIFIED | `alembic.ini`, `migrations/env.py`, and the baseline migration exist; `GovernanceStore.initialize()` now requires migrated tables. |
| 7 | Nebula can use PostgreSQL for the canonical self-hosted path while local tests and development still work through the same migration workflow. | ✓ VERIFIED | `deploy/selfhosted.env.example` uses a Postgres URL; `tests/support.py` migrates SQLite test databases through Alembic before app startup. |
| 8 | Governance-store readiness reflects migrated database connectivity before the app is trusted. | ✓ VERIFIED | `GovernanceStore.health_status()` checks database connectivity and schema presence, and `/health/ready` uses that report. |

**Score:** 8/8 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `Dockerfile` | Container image for the Nebula API | ✓ EXISTS + SUBSTANTIVE | Starts `uvicorn nebula.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000` directly. |
| `docker-compose.selfhosted.yml` | Canonical self-hosted service topology | ✓ EXISTS + SUBSTANTIVE | Defines `nebula`, `postgres`, and `qdrant`; runs `alembic upgrade head` before startup. |
| `docs/self-hosting.md` | Operator deployment guide | ✓ EXISTS + SUBSTANTIVE | Documents the supported self-hosted path, health endpoints, and Postgres migration workflow. |
| `src/nebula/core/config.py` | Runtime guardrails for non-local deployment | ✓ EXISTS + SUBSTANTIVE | Enforces `premium_first`, secret rotation, non-mock premium provider, and `NEBULA_DATABASE_URL`. |
| `src/nebula/main.py` | Liveness and readiness endpoints | ✓ EXISTS + SUBSTANTIVE | Exposes `/health`, `/health/ready`, and `/health/dependencies`. |
| `tests/test_health.py` | Readiness and degraded-mode coverage | ✓ EXISTS + SUBSTANTIVE | Covers degraded optional dependencies and required dependency failure. |
| `alembic.ini` | Alembic CLI configuration | ✓ EXISTS + SUBSTANTIVE | Uses `script_location = migrations`. |
| `migrations/versions/20260315_0001_governance_baseline.py` | Baseline governance migration | ✓ EXISTS + SUBSTANTIVE | Defines the governance tables and brownfield-safe baseline behavior. |
| `src/nebula/services/governance_store.py` | Migration-backed governance repository | ✓ EXISTS + SUBSTANTIVE | Uses SQLAlchemy sessions and no longer contains runtime `CREATE TABLE` DDL. |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|-----|--------|---------|
| `docker-compose.selfhosted.yml` | `Dockerfile` | Compose build configuration | ✓ WIRED | `build:` references the Dockerfile. |
| `docs/self-hosting.md` | `deploy/selfhosted.env.example` | Documented environment setup | ✓ WIRED | The runbook points operators at the shipped env template. |
| `src/nebula/main.py` | `src/nebula/services/runtime_health_service.py` | FastAPI endpoints calling the health service | ✓ WIRED | `/health/ready` and `/health/dependencies` call the runtime health service. |
| `src/nebula/services/runtime_health_service.py` | `src/nebula/services/governance_store.py` | Dependency health inspection | ✓ WIRED | Runtime health aggregates governance-store status directly. |
| `src/nebula/services/governance_store.py` | `src/nebula/db/session.py` | SQLAlchemy session factory | ✓ WIRED | `ServiceContainer` injects the session factory and the store consumes it. |
| `docker-compose.selfhosted.yml` | `alembic.ini` | App startup migration command | ✓ WIRED | The self-hosted app command runs `alembic upgrade head` before `uvicorn`. |

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status | Blocking Issue |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| PLAT-01: Operator can deploy Nebula through one documented self-hosted path without manual code edits | ✓ SATISFIED | - |
| PLAT-02: Operator can run Nebula outside local development with non-default secrets and explicit environment configuration | ✓ SATISFIED | - |
| PLAT-03: Operator can evolve governance persistence through an explicit migration workflow | ✓ SATISFIED | - |
| PLAT-04: Operator can verify gateway readiness, cache health, and governance-store health before sending production traffic | ✓ SATISFIED | - |

**Coverage:** 4/4 requirements satisfied

## Anti-Patterns Found

None — no blocker or warning anti-patterns found in the phase-modified code and docs.

## Human Verification Required

### 1. Fresh Self-Hosted Bring-Up With Real Premium Provider Credentials
**Test:** Copy `deploy/selfhosted.env.example` to a deployment file, fill the real premium/admin/bootstrap secrets, run `docker compose -f docker-compose.selfhosted.yml up -d`, then call `/health`, `/health/ready`, and `/health/dependencies`.
**Expected:** The stack starts without repository edits, migrations apply automatically, `/health` returns `ok`, and readiness shows the gateway and governance store as ready.
**Why human:** Requires a Docker-capable host plus a live premium provider key that is not available in this workspace.

### 2. Degraded Local Optimization While Premium-First Traffic Still Serves
**Test:** Start the self-hosted stack without Ollama, then call `/health/dependencies` and send a request through the gateway.
**Expected:** `local_ollama` reports `degraded`, the gateway and governance store remain ready, and premium-first traffic still serves successfully.
**Why human:** Requires a live deployment where optional local optimization can be intentionally left offline while the rest of the stack is running.

## Gaps Summary

**No gaps found.** Automated phase checks passed and the codebase satisfies the phase must-haves. Real deployment confirmation is still required.

## Verification Metadata

**Verification approach:** Goal-backward using PLAN.md must-haves plus roadmap success criteria
**Must-haves source:** PLAN.md frontmatter
**Automated checks:** `docker compose -f docker-compose.selfhosted.yml config`, `./.venv/bin/alembic upgrade head`, `./.venv/bin/pytest -q`
**Human checks required:** 2
**Total verification time:** 6 min
